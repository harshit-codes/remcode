DEPRECATED: STDIO Bridge for MCP Inspector

⚠️ This STDIO bridge is deprecated due to protocol compatibility issues.
Use the new SSE (Server-Sent Events) endpoints instead.

To use the new SSE-based MCP testing:
1. Start server: npx remcode inspector
2. Connect to SSE: http://localhost:3008/sse/connect
3. Test tools via: http://localhost:3008/sse/mcp

See updated inspector command for full SSE usage instructions.

## Variables
